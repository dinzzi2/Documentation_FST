## 🔷 How to Create a Django Project

### ✅ Step 1: Open Your Terminal

Go to the folder where you want to create your project.  
For example, on your desktop:
```bash
cd Desktop
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Run the `startproject` Command

In your terminal, type:
```bash
django-admin startproject backend
```

✅ This creates a folder called `backend/` with the basic Django project structure.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Move Into the Project Folder

Navigate into your new project folder:
```bash
cd backend
```

Inside, you’ll see files like:
```
backend/
├── manage.py
├── backend/
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── ...
```
